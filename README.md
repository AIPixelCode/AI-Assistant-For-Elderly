# 🧠 Smart Assistant for Elderly Care (Conceptual AI Project)

## 📘 Project Overview
This is a **conceptual project** focused on designing an intelligent home assistant to support elderly individuals. It is based on core Artificial Intelligence principles such as **agent modeling, perception, environment understanding, rational decision-making**, and **generative AI**.

The project is entirely **code-free** and serves as a theoretical exploration of how AI can be applied to real-world social and healthcare challenges.
